An experienced one, 
when deeply practicing mindfulness,
clearly saw a way of being,
relieving all suffering.

What is this way?

K(no)w breath,
k(no)w eye, ear, nose, tongue, skin,
K(no)w sensations,
K(no)w feelings,
K(no)w perceptions,
K(no)w objects,
K(no)w mind,
K(no)w.

With (no)thing more to attain, 
an experienced one relies on this way,
without hindrance. 

Without hindrance, 
there is no fear. 

Far beyond all k(no)wing, 
At last, freedom.

+= nothing to add, 
-= nothing to delete, 
:= nothing is complete.
